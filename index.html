        <p>After spending 6 years as a Process Engineer in Manufacturing, 
            I decided it was time for a career change and enrolled in Computer Science courses
            at North Carolina State University in 2023. I have recently completed their Computer Programming Certificate 
            program and have begun learning code on my own while I look for employment opportunities. I have really enjoyed
            my coding journey so far and I look forward to continuing my learning through personal projects!
        </p>
